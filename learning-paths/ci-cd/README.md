CI/CD - stands for Continuous Integration and Contnuous Deployment.
The standard practice is to write codes using your favuorate editor or Itegrated Devlopment Environment (IDE).
Common code editore incluse command line vi or Graphical user interface like vscode. Another popular one is
Eclipse IDE for different languages, that has framework to support C, C++, Java,Go, Python, php, perl, Scala etc.
Codes are developed and submitted to git repository based on a software project. Thus git is main version control tool.
Codes or sources are mainatined in a tree like structure with master, branches and versioned to track the changes.
Several devloppers in a given team particiapte and agree to have different roles like contributors for documents, testing etc.
The role of sofware devloper (coder) who commits takes the resposibility of fixing if any errors are returned during compilation
or testing or during the patching stage. Patching is an act of changing the code to fix the mainline(master or branch) codes.
THe git has a process call git review without which the code is not submiiied. The review process includes an author and a reviewer.
Reviewers are usually senior members who manage repository for project for minimizing errors and breks in the coding & testin g process.



Jenkins is an open-source continuous integration tool. It is written using the Java
programming language. It facilitates real-time testing and reporting on isolated
changes in a larger code base. This software helps developers to quickly find and
solve defects in their code base & automate testing of their builds.

Jira is a toll which manages pipeline of process starting defining a bunch of backlog tasks which are prioritized by Program Manager.
Program Manager help use agile process using Canban dashboard aor as simple Code, Build, Test processes for Devlopers or Production.

There are many tools for CI/CD and few major ones are described in the link. Please review them.

To be more effetive in underrstanding first start with Git as that's the mother of all automation efforts.

In CI/CD the creation of an image form different sources for bootstrapping is a key element and you may review the https://github.com/buildpacks for this.
